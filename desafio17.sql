 /*ReferÃªncia paara uso do BEFORE:
You cannot change a table while the INSERT trigger is firing. The INSERT might do some locking which could result in a deadlock.
 Also, updating the table from a trigger would then cause the same trigger to fire again in an infinite recursive loop.
  Both of these reasons are why MySQL prevents you from doing this.
